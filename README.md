Deployed directly in front of web and database servers, NetScaler solutions combine highspeed load balancing and content switching, http compression, content caching, SSL acceleration, application flow visibility and a powerful application firewall into an integrated, easy-to-use platform. Meeting SLAs is greatly simplified with end-to-end monitoring that transforms network data into actionable business intelligence. Policies are defined and managed using a simple declarative policy engine, with no programming expertise required.

### Citrix XenApp
Citrix XenApp is the industry-leading solution for virtual application and desktop delivery, providing Windows apps and server-based desktops to workers on any device, anywhere. When deploying XenApp in Azure, applications and desktops are secured in the Azure cloud to protect sensitive information and enhance corporate security.
